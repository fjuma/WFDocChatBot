The use of TLSv1.3 is recommended.

The use of filesystem-realms is recommended.

Using a filesystem-realm instead of a properties-realm is recommended.

When using a filesystem-realm, it's good to enable encryption.

When using a filesystem-realm, it's good to enable integrity checking.

It's better to use a SCRAM SASL mechanism like SCRAM-SHA-512 instead of DIGEST-MD5.

The generate-self-signed-certificate-host key-manager attribute should not be used in a production environment.

When using a credential-reference, it's better to define store and alias attributes instead of specifying a clear-text attribute.
